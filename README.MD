SgmlReaderOld
=============

Converts SGML to XML via XmlReader API.

Programmed by Chris Lovett from Microsoft. Versions 1.8.8 and up seemed to be available on NuGet already. But a project may depend on the workings of an even older version: version 1.7.*, avaiable somewhere some time ago... So for the stability of older projects, this NuGet package may offer this older version. "The Prequel" 😃.
