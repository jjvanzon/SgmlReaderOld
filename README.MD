SgmlReaderOld
=============

Converts SGML to XML via XmlReader API.

Programmed by Chris Lovett from Microsoft. Versions 1.8.8 and up seemed to be available on NuGet already. But a project may depend on an even older version, available somewhere some time ago... For the stability of older projects, this NuGet package may offer this older version 1.7.* "The Prequel" 😃.
